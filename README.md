# Filter-data-using-multiple-dropdowns
I will create multiple drop down list items that will filter and query data independently from a database and display it on a page. I will use a MySQL database, PHP and jQuery.
I am practically using simple skills to try and make filtering data possible, using an example of different restaurants with different menus and a span of multiple food items sold, I can use the different filter options to do a comparison, these includes;
<ol>
<li>Hotel/Restaurant</li>
<li>Category of food sold</li>
<li>Service type.ie.Fast,wait,ready etc</li>
<li>Food price.</li>
</ol>
Any person using such an app would like for the menu to be static, not to reload each time you do a submit, and the dropdown menus to be dependent, each result can be queried further. 
Well I can say the goal is quit achieved, but there is always room for other peoples perspectives and view of the issue as different programmers employ their own paradigms of doing things.

Let us do this together.................
